This project is a React web app for a local multiplayer (2-4 players) spelling bee game. Gameplay is voice-driven: the word is spoken aloud, the player spells it using their voice, and the correct spelling is revealed after the attempt. All game logic is client-side. Prioritize accessibility, clear feedback, and a fun, responsive UI.
